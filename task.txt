Customer X just informed us that we need to churn out a code enhancement ASAP 
for a new project.  Here is what they need:

 
1. We need a Java application that will consume a CSV file, 
parse the data and insert to a SQLite In-Memory database.  

a. Table X has 10 columns A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J which 
correspond with the CSV file column header names.

b. Include all DDL in submitted repository

c. Create your own SQLite DB

 
2. The data sets can be extremely large so be sure the 
processing is optimized with efficiency in mind.  

 
3. Each record needs to be verified to contain the right 
number of data elements to match the columns.  

a. Records that do not match the column count must be 
written to the bad-data-<timestamp>.csv file

b. Elements with commas will be double quoted

 
4. At the end of the process write statistics to a log file

a. # of records received

b. # of records successful

c. # of records failed
